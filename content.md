# My name is <span>Rusty Meadows</span> and I wear many hats!
Currently living in beautiful Los Angeles


## I am a <a target="_blank" href="https://fs.blog/2017/11/generalized-specialist/">“Generalized Specialist”</a> with a deep skillset in ecommerce strategy + development who also has a range of experience across marketing, product development, sourcing, and operations. I work with brands in various strategic and impactful roles to help build exceptional customer expereiences that operate efficiently.


### Ecommerce Strategist
The “hat” that I most often wear is that of Ecommerce Strategist. In this area I have over 10 years of experience with an amazing group of clients. I work with teams big and small to help concept, shape, and implement amazing customer expereiences. Over the past 3 years, I’ve helped both as a consultant as well as in-house and am comfortable in both scenarios. Most recently, I’ve been working with the team at <a target="_blank" href="https://sugarpaper.com">Sugar Paper</a> to help shape thier ecommerce analytics and development roadmap.

### Front End Web Developer
In addition to working with brands on ecommerce strategy, I am also a Front-End Web Developer that specializes in building ecommerce site and expereiences. I work on development projects of all scale, everything from full, turn-key ecommerce sites to tweaking existing Shopify/Wordpress themes. I’m a big believer in technical solutions that reduce complexity and bring joy to both the customer and the operator. I have a sweet spot for HTML/CSS, Ruby, and Shopify’s Liquid but have used various stacks throughout the years and am always playing with new tools! Recently I have been updating a fully-custom wedding planning app that I built for the lovely folks at <a target="_blank" href="https://downeystreetevents.com">Downey Street Events</a>.

### Manufacturing/Sourcing Consultant
I just so happen to also be that person who folks turn to when they need help sourcing products, packaging, marketing materials, brand merchandise, and more! I was lucky enough to serve as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lumi.com">Lumi</a>'s first Head of Product where I developed and implemented product sourcing, merchandising, and logistics for hundreds of customized packaging products. I also developed and sourced all of the packaging during my years at <a target="_blank" href="https://tattly.com">Tattly</a> which included our tattoo products, product packaging, marketing/shipping materials - all on a shoe-string boot-strapped budget. Most recently, during my time at <a target="_blank" href="https://rwguild.com">The Guild</a>, I oversaw the planning, budgeting, design, and sourcing of our massive suite of branded packaging materials used in our SOHO retail store, restuarant, and online store.

### Product Marketer
One of my favorite "hats" I get to wear is one of a Product Marketer helping brands best communicate with thier customers and customers-to-be.

### Project Manager


### Operations Consultant


### Conference Organizer
I was very lucky to work early in my career on some amazing events as a Conference Organizer. I worked on all things community and events for a few years of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.feastongood.com">The Feast</a> events and also helped execute Skillshare's first conference. Following my expereiences in consumer goods, I founded a conference and build a community around consumer product makers called <a target="_blank" href="http://nearlyimpossible.org">Nearly Impossible</a> which meant organizing 3 large conferences and numerous smaller events. My partner and I are actually working on something brand new for Nearly Impossible this year! Stay tuned!
