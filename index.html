        <h3>eCommerce Strategist</h3>
        <p>
          The “hat” that I most often wear is that of eCommerce Strategist. In this area I have over 10 years of experience with an amazing group of clients. I work with teams big and small to help concept, shape, and implement amazing customer expereiences. Over the past 3 years, I’ve helped both as a consultant as well as in-house and am comfortable in both scenarios. Most recently, I’ve been working with the team at <a target="_blank" href="https://sugarpaper.com">Sugar Paper</a> to help shape thier eCommerce analytics and development roadmap.

        <h3>Front-End Web Developer</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to working with brands on eCommerce Strategy, I am also a Front-End Web Developer that specializes in building eCommerce site and expereiences. I work on development projects of all scale, everything from full, turn-key eCommerce sites to tweaking existing Shopify/Wordpress themes. I’m a big believer in technical solutions that reduce complexity and bring joy to both the customer and the operator. I have a sweet spot for HTML/CSS, Ruby, and Shopify’s Liquid but have used various stacks throughout the years and am always playing with new tools! Recently I have been updating a fully-custom wedding planning app that I built for the lovely folks at <a target="_blank" href="https://downeystreetevents.com">Downey Street Events</a>.
